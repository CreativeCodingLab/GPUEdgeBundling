    <h2>GPU Edge Bundling</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    The code in this <a href="https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/GPUEdgeBundling">repo</a> is inspired from
    <a href="https://github.com/upphiminn/d3.ForceBundle">d3.ForceBundle</a>

    <h3>Edge Bundling Algorithms (What Do They Do)</h3>
    Node-link graphs with many edges and nodes suffer from visual clutter, edge-bundling algorithms transform and group
    the edges of a node-link graph in such a way as to improve the readability of the diagram. The process is for example
    analogous to bundling network cable wires along their route in order have a clear understanding of the links between
    entities and structural patterns of the network. There are several algorithms in this class, from ones that use hidden
    user-defined meshes to control the bundling [1], to case specific ones such as for hierarchical data [2] and
    finally to self-organizing methods based on physical force interaction simulations [3].

    <h3>Force Edge Bundling</h3>
    Force edge bundling [3] works by modelling edges between nodes as flexible springs which can attract each other if
    certain geometrical compatibility criterions are met.
    The input for the algorithm is a simple node-link diagram of a graph with nodes and edges. In order to change the
    shape of the basic straight line edges between nodes, the algorithm proceeds by subdividing edges into segments.
    Attraction *spring* forces are simulated between each pair of consecutive subdivision points on the same graph-edge.
    Moreover, attraction *electrostatic* forces are computed between subpoints of different edges which are geometrically
    compatible. The combined force acting on each subdivision point is computed and the points are moved a certain step
    size in the direction of the force. The force-simulation on these sub-points is repeted a certain amout of iterations.
    After the end of a cycle of iterations the resulting graph-edges are divided again in smaller segements and the whole
    process repeats itself until the end cycle is reached. It's important to note that the position of original node-points
    are fixed throughout the simulation.
    This repo contains 2 implementations of the FEB algorithm:

    <ul>
        1. A 2X speed-up version of the CPU-based edge bundling implementation found in
        <a href="https://github.com/upphiminn/d3.ForceBundle">d3.ForceBundle</a>.
        <p></p>
        2. A WebGL-based implementation based on the Jieting Wu et.al. publication [4].
        <p></p>
    </ul>
